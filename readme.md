This is a web application that allows users to upload images, apply various processing operations, and download the processed output. The frontend is built with Next.js, and the backend is powered by FastAPI.

## Prerequisites

### Frontend
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm (v6 or higher)

### Backend
- Python 3.8+
- Pip (Python package installer)

## Setup Instructions

### Frontend (Next.js)

1. Navigate to the `client` directory:

   ```bash
   cd client
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The application should now be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Backend (FastAPI)

1. Navigate to the `server` directory:

   ```bash
   cd server
   ```

2. Install the required Python packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Start the FastAPI server:

   ```bash
   python3 main.py
   ```

   The FastAPI server should now be running at `http://localhost:8000`.

4. Start the background worker (if applicable):

   ```bash
   python3 worker.py
   ```

   This starts the worker process for handling background tasks.

## How It Works

1. **Upload an Image**: Use the frontend to select and upload an image.

2. **Apply Processing Operations**: Choose from a variety of image processing options, such as resizing, filtering, or adjusting brightness.

3. **Download Processed Image**: Once processing is complete, download the processed image directly from the frontend.

## Additional Information

- The frontend and backend communicate via API requests.
- The project utilizes RQ (Redis Queue) and Redis for background task management.
- S3 is used for image storage, and PIL (Python Imaging Library) is used for image processing.
